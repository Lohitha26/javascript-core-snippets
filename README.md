# JavaScript Core Snippets ðŸš€

This repo contains simple, real-world examples of core JavaScript concepts I've learned during my comeback journey.

## Topics Covered

1. **`this` keyword**  
2. **Closures**  
3. **Hoisting**

Each `.js` file has comments and examples written by me to explain how these work under the hood.
